# Bundle

> A small, fast, and opinionated bundler for Deno based on esbuild

Installation:

```bash
deno install -Af --reload -n bundle https://deno.land/x/bundle/cli.ts
```

## Usage

If the defaults look good to you, you can simply just run bundle.

```bash
bundle
```

Sometimes the defaults aren't good (please open an issue!), and you can see and
override them using command line arguments.

Try the help command to see what you can configure.

```bash
bundle -h
```
